<h2>A simple TCP chat server made in Go, to understand the workings of Go routines and channels</h2>

## About
Gocord is a simple shell based TCP chatserver, made as a side project to better understand Go routines and channels.

## Usage

build with:

Make sure the `.env` file has the URL on which the server has to be hosted. (Check `.env-dist` for necessary variables)
